\frametitle{Using Dynamic Compound Hash}
Traditional LSH scheme use L static compound hash functions to reduce false positives.
But it also reduce recall. Many hash tables will be used to improve recall.
~\\~\\

The collision counting LSH~\cite{gan2012locality} uses only a set of single hash function.
Only data points with large enough collision numbers will be considered as cR-NN candidates.
~\\~\\

In case of no data points returned, it uses virtual reranking to equivalently search a neighbor with radius $1, c, c^2, ...$.
