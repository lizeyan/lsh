\section{Conclusion}

LSH is widely used in similarity search and many LSH schemes are proposed.
We review some LSH schemes, and they all use different ways to reduce the consumption of LSH.

We also implement and compare several of them.
We found that multi-probe LSH significantly reduce the number of hash table needed.
But with respect to search time, it requires more search when achieving the same recall with LSH forest.
However, LSH forest suffers from huge build time.
